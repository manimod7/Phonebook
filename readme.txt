Introduction
Project : Implementing a Phonebook using Trie Data Structure
A trie is a kind of search treeâ€”an ordered tree data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually string.
Features of the Project :
1. Search for a contact(Also offers autocomplete feature)
2. Find Contact Number of a Person
3. Insert new contacts into Phonebook
4. Remove contacts from the Phonebook

Running the Program:

The contacts in the Phonebook are saved in a word file named "contactlist.txt" along with the contact number which we have also attached along with the code.
We have entered some word  in the text file for working of the project and your reference.
While entering number of a person when you are inserting a contact in Phonebook please don't use spaces.
For Ex:
Suppose While entering the name of the person "Manish Modwani" input it as as : "Manish_Modwani".
